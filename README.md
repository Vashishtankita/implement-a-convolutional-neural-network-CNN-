# Convolutional Neural Network Implementation

### Repository Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification. It is a practical demonstration of building and evaluating CNNs using a specific dataset. The notebook is designed for educational purposes and can serve as a guide for students and practitioners in the field of deep learning.

### Key Features
1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Includes steps to load, normalize, and preprocess the dataset to prepare it for training.
2. **CNN Architecture Definition**: Builds a CNN model with layers such as convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers using a popular deep learning framework.
3. **Training the Model**: Implements training routines with visualization of training and validation loss/accuracy.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluates the trained model on test data and generates key performance metrics.
5. **Result Visualization**: Provides visualizations of the dataset, training process, and predictions.
